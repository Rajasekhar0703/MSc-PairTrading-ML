# A Machine Learning Approach for Predictive Pair Trading  
**Combining Cointegration with Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM**

## üìå Abstract
This project develops a **hybrid machine learning‚Äìbased pair trading strategy** that integrates advanced predictive models ‚Äî Random Forest, XGBoost, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) ‚Äî with conventional statistical techniques.  

The goal is **intraday trading** by exploiting mean-reverting behavior in **cointegrated stock pairs** from the **S&P 500** and **Dow Jones** indices. Data is sourced from **Alpha Vantage** and **Yahoo Finance**, with cointegration detected via **Engle‚ÄìGranger** and **Johansen** tests.

Key highlights:
- **Technical indicators** (Bollinger Bands, RSI, MACD) extracted for supervised models.
- LSTM for sequential pattern recognition.
- Random Forest & XGBoost for high-precision classification of spread movement.
- Backtested using a rule-based approach.

**Results:**
- **XGBoost**: Best performance ‚Äî avg. profit **$2.12/trade**, Sharpe ratio **0.461**, cumulative return **4.57%**.
- **LSTM**: Strong temporal learning but slightly lower returns (**3.38%**).
- All models outperformed baseline strategies in returns and risk-adjusted metrics.

## üìñ Introduction
The project applies **machine learning** to a **market-neutral pairs trading strategy** that captures short-term mispricing between **statistically related stocks**.

Approach:
- Combine **RNN-based methods** (LSTM) with **econometric analysis** (correlation, cointegration).
- Source **real-time and historical market data** via Alpha Vantage API.
- Generate **long/short trading signals** from predicted spread movements.

Motivation:
- Aligns with the trend toward **data-driven, risk-adjusted investing** in volatile, regulated markets.
- Supports development of **adaptive, automated trading systems**.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- **Develop & evaluate** a machine learning‚Äìdriven pair trading system.
- Predict **mean-reversion opportunities** in cointegrated pairs from S&P 500 and Dow Jones.
- Compare **LSTM** against **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** for signal generation.
- Optimize **profitability** while managing **risk**.

---

## üõ† Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Historical intraday/daily data from Alpha Vantage API & Yahoo Finance.
   - Data cleaning, alignment, normalization.

2. **Pair Selection**  
   - Pearson correlation filtering.
   - Engle‚ÄìGranger & Johansen cointegration tests.

3. **Spread Construction & Feature Engineering**  
   - OLS hedge ratio calculation.
   - Z-score, volatility, technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands).

4. **Model Development**  
   - LSTM (time-series prediction).
   - Random Forest & XGBoost (classification of spread direction).

5. **Backtesting & Evaluation**  
   - Rule-based & ML-based signal integration.
   - Metrics: Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, total profit, win rate.
